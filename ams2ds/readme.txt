Welcome to Automobilista 2 - Dedicated Server.

Command-line applications for Windows and Linux build are provided. 
Run DedicatedServerCmd to launch the server with its default configuration. 
Sample configs are available under config_sample. More detailed documentation is available in UserGuide.pdf.


Recommended system/requirements
===============================

- Any CPU/GPU (Linux build requires 64bit CPU)
- Public static IP
- High uplink bandwidth ; you won't have much luck running this on ADSL if you let many people connect to the server, because it needs to rebroadcast all vehicle updates to all members of the game
